## The Problem
- You need to watch all the videos from a cool new channel you just found, but they have tons of videos
- YouTube used to allow you to append `&list=UL` to any video to get a playlist of a channel's videos in chronological order
- This no longer works

## The Solution
This extension magically finds that use playlist & can play all videos from a channel without opening new tabs

<!--
embed video
-->

1) Go to the Videos tab of a channel  
2) Sort by "Date added (oldest)"

This gets you to YouTube's auto-generated User List playlist in chronological order.  
Don't worry if the current video number is always 20 or doesn't look right, it will still play oldest to newest.
